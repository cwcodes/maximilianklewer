      <h2>Maximilian Klewer</h2>

      <p>
        was born on December 7th in 1981 to a familiy of simple means. His
        father was a merchant and his mother worked as a seamstress. He was
        supposed to become a sign painter but after finishing his training he
        began studying art at the
        <span class="names">Kunstgewerbeschule</span> in Barmen. In 1911 at the
        age of 30 he moved to Berlin and began his studies at the
        <span class="names"
          >KÃ¶nigliche akademische Hochschule fÃ¼r die Bildenden KÃ¼nste</span
        >. From 1919 to 1943, Klewer was the director of the drawing class at
        the Academy which now posessed the name
        <span class="names"> Staatliche Hochschule fÃ¼r Bildende KÃ¼nste</span>.

      <p>
        During the Second World War Klewer was conscripted to work as a
        paramedic. In 1943 a bombing raid targeted at Berlin lead to the
        destruction of some 170 of Klewer's works. Thankfully not all of the
        works had been stored in his Berlin apartement at the time and he
        managed to save 600. Together with his wife Hildegard Kasten, whom he
        had married in 1923, and their youngest of three children Klewer fled
        Berlin and settled in Frankfurt-HÃ¶chst. After the end of the war, the
        artist's family moved to Bad Soden am Taunus, where Klewer died in 1963
        at the age of 82. By the time he died he had been nearly forgotten about
        in the art scene.
